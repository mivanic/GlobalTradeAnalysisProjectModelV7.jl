# GlobalTradeAnalysisProjectModelV7

This is located in `docs/src/index.md`. All of this is in Markdown. I haven't done anything too fancy with your documentation, but I did add docstrings to all exported functions and types, which is required. 

You can also show example code:
```julia
using Pkg

Pkg.add("GlobalTradeAnalysisProjectModelV7")

```

You can even run code in documentation:

```@example
x = 3

x^2
```


```@autodocs
Modules = [GlobalTradeAnalysisProjectModelV7]
Order   = [:function, :type]
```
